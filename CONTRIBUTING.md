# Roadmap

## Near-term

Here is a list of tasks that are presently being worked on:

1. Knowledge representation and reasoning. `Nifty.Knowledge.IReadOnlyFormulaCollection`. It is important to get these models and interfaces right (`Nifty.Knowledge.*`) as they will be utilized throughout the framework.
2. Fluent n-ary SPARQL, querying, query planning, and query optimization. `Nifty.Knowledge.Querying.*` and `Nifty.Knowledge.Querying.Planning.*`. Developers will have "just works" access to the fluent querying of formula collections, e.g., objects' metadata and/or local or remote knowledgebases.
3. Extensibility. `Nifty.Extensibility.*` and exploring the `System.Composition` extensibility framework. Add-ons, plug-ins, extensions, and other dynamically-loaded components will utilize Nifty's knowledge representation and reasoning to provide metadata describing their functionalities and to be interconnected in terms of messages and events.
4. Exploring learner, domain, and pedagogical models and modules and in the context of interoperation with the Microsoft Bot Framework.
5. Implementing a rough-draft dialog system of an intelligent tutoring system in the Microsoft Bot Framework style.
6. Your ideas for contributions and tasks are welcomed.
